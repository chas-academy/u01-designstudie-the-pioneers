### Planing:

**Kanban planing backlog**

***Layout:***

Make a strukture on Github projects so that we can have a backlog on one page and the rest on the development page. Will make it easier to see what issues have priority.

**Backlog(*will have a seperate page in Github project*)**

*The rest will be under the development page*

**To do**

**In progress**

**Done**

**In review**

**Deploy**

More detailed backlog the longer we go. 


### Kanban manager on github

We decide to pick **Ciarán Hayes** to be the manager of Kanban on github. Makes it easier to format and also reduce the risk of error.

 *Example: We make the same issue about the same task 5 diffrent times.* 
 
 So if we have something we want to be in the backlog we contact Ciarán Hayes so he can format it and put it in the github project.

### Next meeting 12:00 @ Monday 22 september on Discord, will be a check up meeting

**To talk about on the meeting on  Thursday 26 september, make user research, leadtimes and check up on the backlog.**

### Meeting ends at 11:35
